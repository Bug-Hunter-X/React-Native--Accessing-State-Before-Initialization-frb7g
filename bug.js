This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This is common when dealing with asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API, where the state update might lag behind the component's render cycle.  It manifests as `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'this.state.myVariable')` or similar messages.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  state = {
    data: null
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data.someProperty}</Text> {/* Error here if data is null */}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
